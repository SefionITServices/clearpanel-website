        question: 'What Linux distributions does clearPanel support?',
        answer: 'clearPanel is optimized for Ubuntu 20.04+ and Debian. The BIND9 DNS module also has partial support for RHEL/AlmaLinux. The installer uses apt and Ubuntu-native tooling (UFW, systemd, Ondřej PHP PPA).',
    },
    {
        question: 'Do I need to know the command line to use clearPanel?',
        answer: 'No. clearPanel is designed so that everyday tasks — creating domains, managing email, editing DNS records, deploying SSL certificates — can all be done through the web UI. SSH access is only needed for the initial installation.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How is this different from cPanel or Plesk?',
        answer: 'clearPanel starts at $3.99/month with unlimited domains — compared to cPanel\'s $20/month. It uses a modern NestJS + React 18 stack, supports Cloudflare Tunnel for non-public IPs, and includes an authoritative BIND9 DNS server so you don\'t depend on external DNS providers.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I run clearPanel if I\'m behind NAT or CGNAT?',
        answer: 'Yes. clearPanel supports Cloudflare Tunnel out of the box. This means home servers, mini-PCs, and VPS environments without a public IP can still run the panel and have it publicly accessible.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Does clearPanel manage email security (DKIM, DMARC, SPF)?',
        answer: 'Yes. The email stack includes OpenDKIM for DKIM signing, DMARC policy configuration, Rspamd for spam filtering, and ClamAV for antivirus. This is all provisioned automatically when you add a mail domain.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What databases does clearPanel support?',
        answer: 'clearPanel supports MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL through a single unified interface. You get a built-in SQL console, user and privilege management, import/export, and phpMyAdmin from the App Store.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Is clearPanel production-ready?',
        answer: 'Version 2.1.0 (Phase 1 complete) is feature-stable with critical security issues resolved: bcrypt password hashing, TOTP 2FA, scoped sudoers, DTO validation on all API endpoints, and terminal command filtering. It is suitable for single-admin VPS deployments.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I get started with clearPanel?',
        answer: 'Pick the Starter plan at $3.99/month or contact us for a Custom plan. After subscribing, you receive the installer and a license key. Run the installer on a fresh Ubuntu VPS and the full panel is live in minutes.',
